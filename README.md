# GitHub Stargazers

GitHub Stargazers is a web application that fetches and displays a list of stargazers for a given GitHub repository. The app allows users to search for repositories, view stargazers in a table with auto-complete filtering, and export the stargazer list to a CSV file. Users can also provide a GitHub Personal Access Token for authentication, allowing them to bypass rate limits on the GitHub API.

This application was created with the help of GPT-4, an advanced AI language model developed by OpenAI. GPT-4 was used to generate code snippets, offer suggestions, and help create a React-based user interface, which interacts with the GitHub API to fetch the stargazer data.
